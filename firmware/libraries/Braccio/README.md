# Braccio Library

## Description

An [Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)/[Wiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiring_(development_platform)) library to control the TinkerKit Braccio robotic arm.

This library simplifies the control of the Braccio by providing a set of basic methods to control each joint of the arm.

There are several examples provided, including a basic serial control example, to allow control from a separate board, such as the Esplora (which has a built-in joystick, as well as buttons and a slider).
